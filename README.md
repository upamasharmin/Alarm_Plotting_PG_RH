# Alarm_Plotting_PG_RH
It is a project of EDOTCO Bangladesh. The project is done to plot the most recent alarms from different sources to decide their validity during a portable generator's run time. To make the right validity decision I have to go through various conditions and pre-processing. This automation was done to make the accurate run hour calculation of the portable generator and minimize its cost, and also to see the fraud activity around it.These are solely done by Python raw coding using the Panda and Numpy libraries.
