# Alarm_Plotting_PG_RH
It is a time-series analysis project of EDOTCO. The project is done to plot the most recent alarms from different sources to make the decision of their validity during a portable generator's run time. To make the right validity decision I have to go through different conditions and pre-processing part. All of these are solely done by Python raw coding using the Panda and Numpy libraries.
